# Django-Live-Series
All course files for the Django playlist on Mozilla Firefox Club VIT YouTube channel.

## How to use these files
Each session in the playlist has it's own branch in this repository. To see the code for that session, choose the appropriate branch. E.g. to see the code for session 1, checkout the Session-1 branch.

**important** - if you are cloning the repo to your desktop, you will need to perform a `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install any dependencies that the project may have at that point of the course.
